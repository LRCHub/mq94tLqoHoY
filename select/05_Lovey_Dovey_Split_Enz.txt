My house is sliding into the sea
Skies are grey, since you've been away
The chickens aren't laying eggs no more
It can only mean you left me for sure

But I still think of you when I'm alone
How can I ever repay you for what you do to me
I still think of you when I'm alone
How can I ever repay you for what you're doin' to me

La do dah la do dah dah la do dah

My trees are all turning brown
The sun won't shine, now you're no longer mine
The rats are crawlin' up me back
It can only mean you're never coming back

But I still, think of you when I'm alone
Oh how could I ever repay you for what you're doin' to me
And I still, think of you when I'm alone
Oh how could I ever repay you for what you're doin' to me

La do dah la do dah dah la do dah
Wooh!

My bed is leaning to one side
You know I can't sleep now that I've lost my pride
The flies are swarming in like bees
I even have to share my clothes with fleas

But I still, think of you when, I'm alone
How can I ever repay you for what you're doin' to me
And I still, think of you when, I'm alone
How can I ever repay you for what you're doin' to me
Right now!

La do dah la do dah dah la do dah
