INSTRUMENTAL
It's so cliche - again today I am alone
I'm so bored - eventually this day will
Woo just pass by like this

Look look, look at those passing by couples
I can love like that too but
Woo I'm so lonely

Me too, Lovey Dovey Dovey Uh Uh Uh Uh
Lovey Dovey Dovey Uh Uh Uh Uh
Don't leave me alone now
Now Lovey Dovey Dovey Uh Uh Uh Uh
Lovey Dovey Dovey Uh Uh Uh Uh
Where are you?

Lovey Dovey Dovey Uh Uh Uh Uh
Lovey Dovey Dovey Uh Uh Uh Uh
I will definitely find you
Being abandoned, I'm melting, dying
Where exactly are you?

It's so cold to spend a day alone
I would like it if I wasn't alone
Woo I would really like it

Look look, look at me over here
Tonight's darkness is so
Woo It's so scary

Me too, Lovey Dovey Dovey Uh Uh Uh Uh
Lovey Dovey Dovey Uh Uh Uh Uh
Don't leave me alone now
Now Lovey Dovey Dovey Uh Uh Uh Uh
Lovey Dovey Dovey Uh Uh Uh Uh
Where are you?

Lovey Dovey Dovey Uh Uh Uh Uh
Lovey Dovey Dovey Uh Uh Uh Uh
I will definitely find you
Being abandoned, I'm melting, dying
Where exactly are you?

All alone all day woo All alone every single day woo The darkness is really really - without you, by myself
A day is too long woo Me too, Lovey Dovey Dovey Uh Uh Uh Uh
Lovey Dovey Dovey Uh Uh Uh Uh
Don't leave me alone now
